## Introduction

This printer is used for our prototyping ad low volume production.  It's a third order derivative of the original hypercube designed by [Tech2C](https://www.thingiverse.com/Tech2C/about) and [SCOTT_3D](https://www.thingiverse.com/SCOTT_3D/about). and digitally housed here in this repository.  We've abandoned the single Z-platform version and only focus on the dual drive version.  

We've made some changes to the design and as part of our change control discipline keep track of those changes in this repository.  while the master branch of this repository should always contain a compatible set of design documents, you should rely on tagged versions for commits that are certain to have a coherent and compatible set of documents.

### Tools

This repository uses spaceclaim, so  design files are in their sdoc format.  In tagged commits you will that the latest completed assembly will exist in STEP format for that tagged release.  these will be more useful for you if you're a solidworks or (sic) Fusion360 user.

If you're looking for a power 3d design tool for viewing this machine, or to design for 3d printing, We recommend DesignSpark mechanical.  It's a white label (limited/older) of SpaceClaim Engineer.
